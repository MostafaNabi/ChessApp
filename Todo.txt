Bugs
    Declaring objects in header file seems to call their default constructors.
    Types::remove_all_char does not work


Server.js
    Make sure server is reset on refresh


WebInterface.cc
    Turn web interface into a class with constructor that accepts
    initial board state and an int value for AI strength (0 for no AI)

Chess.cc
    Change constructors to as follows
        Chess(string fen)
        Chess(string fen, int ai_strength)


BoardView.js
    Create tiles dynamically from BoardView constructors,
    the index.html file is unreadable

    Seperate the WebInterface instances using url paths.
    For example:
        server.post('/singleplayer:make_move');
        server.post('/twoplayer:make_move');




Flow:
    BoardView->Server.js.init() // create web interface
