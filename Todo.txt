Bugs
    [1] Declaring objects in header file seems to call their default constructors.





TODO
    Fix bug 1, then test the Board and Chess classes including copy and move constructors.
    And Board creation using the FEN parser.


Server.js
    Make sure server is reset on refresh





BoardView.js
    Create tiles dynamically from BoardView constructors,
    the index.html file is unreadable

    Seperate the WebInterface instances using url paths.
    For example:
        server.post('/singleplayer:make_move');
        server.post('/twoplayer:make_move');




Flow:
    BoardView->Server.js.init() // create web interface
