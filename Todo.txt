    Separate move bitboards and fully valid moves.
    Move bitboards should only check that the target square is valid, i.e
    within reach and not occupied by the same piece. It should not do any checks
    like whether it results in check etc. Functions returning fully valid moves
    should use the move bitboards and then process their own checks. These
    functions should not return bitboards but arrays/vectors of a custom type
    Move object.

    For north, north east, east rays intersect with opponent pieces and get the LSB.
    The intersect with own pieces, choose the result that is the smallest and use that
    to find the last position to stop. The actual move bitboard would be ~LSB for same pieces
    and ~LSB | LSB for opponent pieces.


Dissertation Notes: 
    To get the LSB for uints do (~x + 1).
    Let x = 0100 1000
       ~x = 1011 0111
       +1 = 1011 1000
    By adding 1 the final three 1s will carry over and be removed.
    If the final digit in x was a 1 then:
        x = 0100 1001
       ~x = 1011 0110
       +1 = 1011 0111
    The plus 1 will always set the final bit in (~x)to be same
    as in x.
