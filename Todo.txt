    Separate move bitboards and fully valid moves.
    Move bitboards should only check that the target square is valid, i.e
    within reach and not occupied by the same piece. It should not do any checks
    like whether it results in check etc. Functions returning fully valid moves
    should use the move bitboards and then process their own checks. These
    functions should not return bitboards but arrays/vectors of a custom type
    Move object.
